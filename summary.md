# 1. Introduction and Foundations

## Introduction

### Requirement

A condition / capability needed by a user to solve a problem

A condition / capability needed by a system to satisfy a contract

### Stakeholder

Entity that has an (indirect or direct) influence on the requirements of a system

### Requirements Engineering

Four core activities:

- Elicitation : obtain requirements from stakeholders
- Documentation: document the elicited requirements
- Validation and Negotiation : validate and renegotiate the documented requirements early on
- Management: Continously manage requirements

REQEN in Waterfall: one time activity at the beginning of the process

REQEN in agile: continous collateral process (is performed many times)

## Requirement Types

### Functional Requirements

Define the function that the system offers

Divided into:

- functional
- behavioral
- data

### Quality Requirements

Define the quality of the system. Often make a much bigger impact on the system architecture than the functional requirements

These are requirements which define the:

- performance
- security
- reliability
- usability
- maintainability
- portability

(the - ilitys)

### Constraints

A requirement that limits the possible solutions

# System and Context Boundaries

## System Context

Describes the part of the system that is relevant for definition and understanding
(the system itself + everything influencing the system in any way)

## System and Context Boundaries

System Boundary: Seperates the reality which can be modified from the reality which cannot

Context Boundary: Seperates the irrelevant part of reality from the relevant part
